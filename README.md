# OpenGL-Rasterizer

This project is a GPU implementation of my [Software-Rasterizer](https://github.com/EmilBjorkeng/Software-Rasterizer) using OpenGL.
It loads OBJ files and renders them in a 3D environment. It loads OBJ files and renders them in a 3D environment. Unlike the Software-Rasterizer, this project uses the GLM math library for advanced math (like vectors and matricies) instead of a custom implementation.

For more information on the origins of this project, see the GitHub repository for the [Software-Rasterizer](https://github.com/EmilBjorkeng/Software-Rasterizer).
